# Sidebar Navigation Links
# First create the .md file(s) at the root of this project with front matter specifying the layout as page and title as the navigation title
# For example:  
# ---
# layout: page
# title: About
# --- 
# Is the front matter for about.md to create a sidebar navigation link of an About page.
# Once the .md file(s) has(have) been created, specify again the title and also the relative url path in YAML as below 
# For example:
# - title: About
#  url: /about/

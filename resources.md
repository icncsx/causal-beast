While the bulk of the course is outlining the theory behind each causal inference technique, the course does `not aspire to be an abstract exercise`. For each topic, I've tried to introduce real world studies that utilize at least one of the five techniques introduced in the course. If you feel they have been inadequate to give you a good grasp of the core concepts, I have appended below many exceptional and also easy to follow research papers that will improve your understanding.
